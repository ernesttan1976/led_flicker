I'll revise the code to use only `uv` for dependency management instead of pip. The `uv` tool is a faster Python package installer and resolver that's compatible with pip packages but offers improved performance.

Let me adjust the application to use `uv` and provide the installation instructions:

# LED Flicker Detector with Panel UI

I've created a user-friendly application with a simple UI that detects LEDs with abnormal flicker patterns in videos. This implementation uses the same core algorithm but is set up to use `uv` for dependency management instead of pip.

## Installation with uv

To set up the environment with `uv`, follow these steps:

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create a new virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies with uv
uv install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scipy scikit-learn panel pillow
```

You can also create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
opencv-python
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
scikit-learn
panel
pillow
```

Then install all dependencies at once:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

After installing dependencies, run the application with:

```bash
panel serve app.py --show
```

This will start a local web server and open the application in your browser.

## How It Works

The application provides a straightforward workflow:

1. **Simple UI**: Upload your video file through the file input box
2. **Automatic Analysis**: The app processes the video to detect and analyze LED flicker patterns
3. **Visual Results**: Displays the results with:
   - Failing LEDs circled in red with labels
   - Normal LEDs marked with small green circles

## Key Features

- **User-friendly interface** - Clean Panel UI with clear instructions
- **Automated detection** - No need to manually select LEDs
- **Visual feedback** - Clearly highlights the problematic LEDs
- **Fast analysis** - Processes up to 300 frames to balance accuracy and speed

The code is designed to be easy to run and modify as needed. If you encounter any specific LED detection challenges with your videos, the brightness threshold (currently set at 200) can be adjusted in the code.
